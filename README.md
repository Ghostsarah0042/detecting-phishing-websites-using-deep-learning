Detecting phishing websites using machine learning (deep learning) with tensorflow keras. With accuracy of 97.3%
# What Is Phishing Attack
Phishing attack is a type of cyber-attack where attacker sends fraudulent (spoofed, fake or deceptive) messages designed to lure a human victim to give away personal information or credentials or to deploy malicious software in victim's infrastructure like ransomware. As Internet usage is increasing day by day so are the cyber-crimes and scams. Phishing is one of the latest sophisticated techniques used by the scammers.
## How Phising Website Detection Helps Users
Phishing website detection can help the users to avoid falling victim to these attacks. Although phishing websites are disguised as a legitimate one, fortunately they have some identifiable features. 
## Phising Website Detection Using Deep Learning 
I have proposed a supervised learning approach using deep learning algorithm to detect phishing websites. I have achieved 97.3% accuracy using Artificial Neural Network model. I have used a dataset downloaded from kaggle.
